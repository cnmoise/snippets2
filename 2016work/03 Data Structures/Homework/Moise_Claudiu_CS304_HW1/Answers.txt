Note to the intructor: I have made comments in the code as a form of notes
to aid my understanding. I have made sure they do not obstruct the code,
hopefully it is not an issue.

P1.

A. Legal, returns an int and stores in into temp
B. Illeagal, invokes method of the Date class on an IncDate object, 
without using super.getYear()
C. Illeagal, invokes an IncDate method onto a Date obj. The date class
has no method to handle this
D. Legal, all methods within scope
E. Legal, Date2 now points to the same value as Date 1
F. Illeagal, a superclass obj cannot point to a subclass obj
G. Legal, IncDate is a subclass of the Date class, therefore assigning an
IncDate to point to a Date obj isn't a violation
