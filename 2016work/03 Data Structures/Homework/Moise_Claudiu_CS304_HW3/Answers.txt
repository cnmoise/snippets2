P1.
A. False
B. True
C. True
D. False
E. True
F. False
G. False
H. True

P2.
A. Yes, its always good practice to catch errors
B. Yes because in the case where we increment once and try to do another
calculation with the resulting date we may accidentally do the operation
on an invalid date. Either you check at the begining of every method to
see if you have a valid date, or check at the end of increment.

P3.
The big difference is that an array stack is forced to be bounded, therefore
we need to be sure we don't put more elements than there are spaces. A reference
based stack has as much space as memory allows. Of course when we use references
we must ensure the links are never severed.

P4.
A. The base case is when we return 1 (if the base is the same number as the limit)
B. General case is contained in our else statement.
C. The constraint is that we cannot have a base that is a larger value
than the limit.

P5.
A. -1
B. 120
C. 1
