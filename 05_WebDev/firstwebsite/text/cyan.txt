Blue (Cyan)

Cyan is a greenish-blue color. In the subtractive color system, cyan is one of the primary colors (the others being magenta, yellow, and black). This color system is primarily used in color printing, whereby the overlap of two colors will in fact subtract how much of the other color is visible.

For instance: 
The amount of cyan applied to a white sheet of paper controls how much of the red in white light will be reflected back from the paper.

In western culture the color blue is often associated with security and authority which is why many banks will use blue in their logo. It can also be associated with sadness (having the blues).

Cyan is a cold, restful color.
