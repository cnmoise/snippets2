					<ul>
						<li style="font-size:16px;">Inverse Paris</li>
					</ul>
						<p style="font-size:12px">This world is where all of the people are as nice as the Canadians in our world and 
							not as <i>stuck up</i>. 
							Here, many swapping of cultures happen and anything from the regular world had before will be reversal
							from what you are used to. There are no French Revolutions here, just Dance Dance Revolutions and this 
							is all just one polite party.
							</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li style="font-size:16px;">Heaven</li>
					</ul>
						<p style="font-size:12px">a vacation in paradise where you get served all the good things 24/7 and have 
							endless amounts of joy and the only way to exit is to physically fall from a high mountain peak called Grace. 
							Fortunately there is a portal lying on the bottom of it there.
							We left it there for fun because who would want to leave Heaven you monster.
							</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="font-size:16px;">Planes, Trains, and Frozenmobiles</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="font-size:12px">this planet is just covered in ice cream and gelato in every flavor we could ever 
							imagine and has a COOL transit system for you to tour through. Great for the sweet tooth, awful if you fall in 
							trying to propose to your significant other, because after all, you can’t be a sweetheart and cold to someone at 
							the same time.
							</p>

				<p style="font-size:20px; color:Purple; background-color:black; border:solid;border-radius:50%; text-align:center">Experience Dimensions</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li style="font-size:16px;">Re-Do</li>
				</ul>
						<p style="font-size:12px">A dimension where you step into your alternate world self’s shoes in which you can live
							out what your life could have been if you made different choices by starting at the beginning of your life. 
							Many paths will lead to many more and all the paths begin with the first choice. You may save and restart your 
							lives at anytime but be careful, you may forget which one is your real life.
							</p>
					
				<ul>
					<li style="font-size:16px;">Super Smash Powers</li>
				</ul>
						<p style="font-size:12px">Using Earth as the backdrop, you live our your life with superpowers that you can 
							choose and develop throughout your stay here. The strength of your powers are directly related to the amount 
							that you “donate” to us.
							</p>
					
				<ul>
					<li style="font-size:16px;">Refund Lab</li>
				</ul>
						<p style="font-size:12px">a retail simulation mall where you choose to either shop till you drop or ethically sell things 
							and legally obtain money. Comes with a stock market and Black Friday option to supercharge the madness.
							</p>
				
				
				<p style="font-size:20px; color:Blue; background-color:black; border:solid;border-radius:50%; text-align:center">Learning Centers</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li style="font-size:16px;">Jurassic Universe</li>
				</ul>
				
					<p style="font-size:12px">a world that contains many other beasts, creatures, and living organisms from the past 
							and beyond the stars. We offer all researchers that chose this location to legally write that there will be no legal 
							charges pressed against is if they encounter any wildlife that causes harm. We would not want another Harambe situation
							especially since it’s under our legal system.
