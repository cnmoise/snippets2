							<!--Educational background/why did you choose this course-->					
							I am a NEIU Junior studying for a double concentration in Cyber Security and Informational Technologies.
							I am also minoring in Communications and a member of the Honors Program at NEIU.
							My dad is a big techie, so I have been learning about programing and computers
							since I was a wee lad. These two experiences combined have gifted me with a modest background in the subject. 
		
					</td>
					<td colspan="4">
							I chose this class because I see making websites as a <b>critical skill in our contemporary digital world.</b>
							Everyone needs websites and there are new websites being made every day. One of my hopes after taking this
							course is that it will help me figure out my direction as a professional.

						 People ask me where my accent is from. I tell them they will never guess. They never do.
						So we play a small game where the other person names every
						single European country they have ever heard of until I tell them I am from Romania
						(you know, that country that JK Rowling says is populated solely by Dragons and Vampires).
						My family came to the US when I was about 10 or 11 and I have lived here some 10 odd years.
