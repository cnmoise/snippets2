Deep Green

It is well known that different cultures associate different meanings with the same colors. The color green however has the most consistent meaning across cultures with nature, life and health. This is probably drawn from day to day observation of natural processes.

Yet green in nature is not a universally positive attribute. Bacteria and mold can cause people and objects to have a greenish hue. Therefore certain shades of green can also be used to indicate toxicity and sickness.

Because green is at the very center of our perceivable color spectrum, our eyes do not need to adjust when they see green. This has the effect of soothing the mind and body.

Green is a cool color which soothes the mind and body.
