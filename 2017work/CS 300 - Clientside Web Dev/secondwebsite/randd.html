						<p style="text-indent: 20px;">Let us use Schrodinger’s cat as an example. If a physicist places a live cat in a box with a bomb that has a 50% chance of detonating after the lid is closed, there is no way of knowing whether the cat is alive or dead without reopening the box. 
							The cat is in a Superposition State. <br></br> 
							This means that it is in a state that is neither alive nor dead, but a mixture of both possibilities.
							The same sort of thing happens to physical systems at a quantum scale, like an electron orbiting a hydrogen atom. The electron is not orbiting at all. It is everywhere in space, all at once, with more of a probability of being at some places than others. It is only after we measure its position that we can pinpoint where it is at that exact moment a lot like we did not know whether the cat was alive or dead until we opened the box.
							Now, lets say we have two boxes of cats. Due to the Superposition State, there is a 25% of each outcome where both cats are alive, both cats are dead, one alive and one dead, vice versa.
							Quantum Mechanics allows us to remove the possibility that both cats are alive and both cats are dead options.<br></br> 
							There is now a two-cat system where one cat must be alive and one has to be dead. Real world lab experiments have 
							shown that two subatomic particles entangled in a superposition state where if one spins in a clockwise direction, 
							the other one must spin in a counterclockwise direction no matter where they are located. <br></br> 
							This is the rule of Quantum Entanglement.
							With the help of Wormholes and alien technology, our portal does not have to be a gamble where we can either land up alive and/or dead after using the portal.<br></br> 
							The alien technology allows us to pinpoint the exact destination inside the wormhole, and remove the probability where the portal user is dead after being in a Superpositioned State. Neat, huh?
							You may be wondering how this mind-blowing device is powered. The device is powered by Isotope X7394 found in the core of select stars in the Zorbulon cluster in Dimension 784.<br></br> 
							Due to proprietary reasons, we will not name the stars where Isotope X7394 is located.
							In the end, we managed to decode the alien language and modify it to our specific needs: Dimensional and Time Travel. <br></br> 
							By modifying the alien code, the portal could be used by any living organism across any interdimensional plane.<br></br>

						<p style="text-indent: 20px;">We have created a prototype of a miniature version of the portal generator that can be used anywhere on the go. 
						For the sake of simplicity, we have dubbed the prototype as the “Portal Gun”. 
						The portal gun is still under development, and we do not have any official dates when the device is going to be released.<br></br> 
						We have decided to withhold the portal gun to the public due to its infinite reality-altering possibilities. 
						The portal gun will be used for emergency purposes, such as a backup plan to our other back-up plans.</p>
