5 variable sum, i, and j are not declared at the begining of the program
the only reason this is a problem for i is because i is used outside of
the for loop it is originally declared in

10 adding ; at the end of the if statement makes the code following it not execute
11 no ; , the compiler runs into an error reading this
15 same as 10, while loop does not execute
18 same as 11
25 same as 11, this only applies to do while loops
